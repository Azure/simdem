# Welcome to SimDem

To progress in tutorial mode press a key when prompted. Most keys will work, but some are special keys. So, for now, press space when prompted.
  
## Simdem is Documentation, Tutorials, and Tests

Simdem allows you to wite a tutorial in markdown format and then run
the commands within it as an interactive tutorial or
even a test script. You can also generate executable shell scripts.

SimDem reads a script, written in the form of a human readable
Markdown file, and executes the commands within this script on your
behalf. It will even make it look like you are really typing the
commands, which is great if you want to concentrate on explaining what
you are doing but still run the demo live.

It's easier to describe if you see it working. In fact you are already
in a SimDem. Press a key (other than 'b', we'll look at that shortly)
to "type" a command, once the command has been "typed" hit
a key to execute the command.

# Next Steps

Tutorials can branch too, for example you can choose any of the
following paths next:

  1. [Hello World Demo](demo/README.md) 
  2. [Modes of operation](modes/README.md)
  3. [Write SimDem documents](syntax/README.md)
  4. [Special Commands](special_commands/README.md)
  5. [Configure your scripts through variables](variables/README.md)
  6. [Write multi-part documents](multipart/README.md)
  7. [Use your documents as automated tests](test/README.md)
