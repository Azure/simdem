# Welcome to SimDem

Is it:

  * Documentation
  * An interactive tutorial
  * A live demo 
  * An automated test script
  * A Shell script
  
## Simdem is Documentation, Tutorials, Demo's and Tests

It's all of them!

Simdem allows you to wite a tutorial in markdown format and then run
the commands within it as a simulated demo, interactive tutorial or
even a test script. You can also generate executable shell scripts.

SimDem reads a script, written in the form of a human readable
Markdown file, and executes the commands within this script on your
behalf. It will even make it look like you are really typing the
commands, which is great if you want to concentrate on explaining what
you are doing but still run the demo live.

It's easier to describe if you see it working. In fact you are already
in a SimDem. Press a key (other than 'b', we'll look at that shortly)
to "type" a command, once the command has been "typed" hit
a key to execute the command.
