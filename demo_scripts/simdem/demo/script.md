# Hellow World SimDem Demo

This script is intended to be used to demonstrate the key features of
Simdem.

```
echo "Hello World"
```

```
echo "It might look like this was typed into the terminal (even more so if you ran SimDem with the '--style simulate' flag), bit it really comes from a markdown file."
```

The date command will prove this is running in real time.

```
date
```

Results: Expected similarity: 0.3
