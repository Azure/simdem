# Prerequisites

This is the prerequisite section.  SimDem looks for a set of links to extract and run through first

* [prereq-ignored](./prereq-ignored.md)

They don't even need to be in the same list

* [prereq-processed](./prereq-processed.md)

By this point, the prerequisites have either run or have passed their validation

# Validation

```shell
echo prereq_ignored = $prereq_ignored
echo prereq_processed = $prereq_processed
```
