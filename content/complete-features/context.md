# Do stuff here

We want to execute this because the code type is shell

```shell
echo foo
echo bar
```

# Do more stuff here

```shell
echo baz
```

# Results

The only thing that makes it a result is the code type is result.
We assume the result is for the last command of the last code block

```result
baz
```
