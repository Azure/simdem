# Demo (or Simulation) mode

Demo mode is ideal if you are using this to teach or demonstrate how
to achive the goal. In this mode no descriptive text is shown, instead
when you press a key the next command is "typed", pressing another key
will execute the command. The idea is that you describe what is
happening as the application "types" the command for you.

To run a document in Demo Mode: `simdem -m demo examples/simple/README.md`
