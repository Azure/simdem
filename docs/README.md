# Welcome to SimDem

SimDem is:

  * Documentation
  * An interactive tutorial
  * A live demo 
  * An automated test script
  * A Shell script
  
## SimDem overview

Simdem allows you to wite a tutorial in markdown format and then run the commands as a simulated demo, interactive tutorial or even a test script. You can also generate executable shell scripts.

SimDem reads a Markdown file and executes the code block commands embedded within. It can even look like you are really typing the commands, which is great if you want to concentrate on explaining what you are doing but still run the demo live.

It's easier to understand through example. If you are viewing this inside the interactive demo, press a key (other than 'b', we'll look at that shortly) to "type" a command, once the command has been "typed" hit a key to execute the command.
