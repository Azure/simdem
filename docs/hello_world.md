# Hello World

This is the start of a hello-world example.

## Running commands

To run a set of commands, insert them inside a code block.  Here's an example:

```shell
echo "hello world"
```

To verify output, add a "Results:" paragraph immediately after your command:

```shell
echo "hello again"
```

Results:

```
hello again
```
