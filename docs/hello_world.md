# Hello World

This is the start of a hello-world example.

## Running commands

To run a set of commands, insert them inside a code block.  Here's an example:

NOTE: If running in tutorial or demo mode, you will need to press a key to tell SimDem to execute the command

```shell
echo "hello world"
```

To verify output, add a "Results:" paragraph immediately after your command:

```shell
echo "hello again"
```

Results:

```
hello again
```

# Next Steps

Tutorials can branch too, for example you can choose any of the following paths next:

1. [SimDem document syntax](syntax.md)
1. [Use your documents as interactive tutorials or demos](mode_demo.md)
1. [Use your documents as automated tests](mode_test.md)
1. [FIN](fin.md)
